# Introduction

The [`Fractions`][fractions] module allows us to create and work with [`rational numbers`][rational]: fractions with an integer numerator divided by an integer denominator.
For example, we can store `2/3` as an exact fraction instead of the approximate `float` value `0.6666...`.

Unlike `int`, `float`, and `complex` numbers, fractions do not have a literal form.
However, the fractions constructor is quite flexible.

Most obviously, it can take take two integers as arguments.
Common factors are automatically removed, converting the fraction to its "lowest form": the smallest integers that accurately represent the fraction:

```python
>>> from fractions import Fraction

>>> f1 = Fraction(2, 3) # 2/3
>>> f1
Fraction(2, 3)

>>> f2 = Fraction(6, 9)
>>> f2
Fraction(2, 3)  # automatically simplified

>>> f1 == f2
True
```

The fractions constructor can also parse a string representation:

```python
>>> f3 = Fraction('2/3')
>>> f3
Fraction(2, 3)
```

Fractions can also work with `float` parameters, but this may run into problems with the approximate nature of representing the decimal value internally as binary.
For more on this representation issue, see the [0.30000000000000004][0.30000000000000004] website, and [Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations ][fp-issues] in the Python documentation.

For a more reliable result when using floats with fractions, there is the `<fraction>.limit_denominator()` method.


## Arithmetic with Fractions

The usual [`arithmetic operators`][operators] `+ - * / **` will work with fractions, as with other numeric types.

Integers and other `Fraction`s can be included in the equation and give a `Fraction` result.
Including a `float` in the expression results in `float` output, with a consequent (possible) loss in precision:

```python
>>> Fraction(2, 3) + Fraction(1, 4) # addition
Fraction(11, 12)

>>> Fraction(2, 3) * Fraction(6, 5) # multiply fractions
Fraction(4, 5)

>>> Fraction(2, 3) * 6 / 5 # fraction with integers
Fraction(4, 5)

>>> Fraction(2, 3) * 1.2  # fraction with float -> float
0.7999999999999999

>>> Fraction(2, 3) ** 2  # exponentiation with integer
Fraction(4, 9)
```

Various standard Python numeric functions also give the result you might expect from working with `int` and `float` types:

```python
>>> round(Fraction(11, 3))
4

>>> from math import floor, ceil
>>> floor(Fraction(11, 3))
3
>>> ceil(Fraction(11, 3))
4

>>> float(Fraction(11, 3))
3.6666666666666665
```
