Fibonacci Solutions
Exercise 13
Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.(Hint: The Fibonacci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …)

Sample solution
There are so many ways that you can use functions to generate Fibonacci numbers. Here is one user-submitted solution:

def gen_fib():
    count = int(input("How many fibonacci numbers would you like to generate? "))
    i = 1
    if count == 0:
        fib = []
    elif count == 1:
        fib = [1]
    elif count == 2:
        fib = [1,1]
    elif count > 2:
        fib = [1,1]
        while i < (count - 1):
            fib.append(fib[i] + fib[i-1])
            i += 1

    return fib

And another:

def fibonacci():
    num = int(input("How many numbers that generates?:"))
    i = 1
    if num == 0:
        fib = []
    elif num == 1:
        fib = [1]
    elif num == 2:
        fib = [1,1]
    elif num > 2:
        fib = [1,1]
        while i < (num - 1):
            fib.append(fib[i] + fib[i-1])
            i += 1
    return fib
print(fibonacci())
input()
