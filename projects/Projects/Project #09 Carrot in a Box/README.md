___
_by Al Sweigart_ [al@inventwithpython.com](mailto:al@inventwithpython.com)

A silly bluffing game between two human players. Based on the game
from the show [8 Out of 10 Cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UGuPvrsG3E).

## TODO List:
* [ ] Change the ASCII art for the boxes and carrots to something more ornate.
* [ ] Add a “would you like to play again?” feature that lets the players play again while keeping score.
* [ ] Add a third player that the second player must bluff to.
