## TODO List:

* [x] ~~Try changing `NUM_DIGITS` to 1 or 10.~~
* [x] ~~Try changing `MAX_GUESSES` to 1 or 100.~~
* [x] ~~Try designing a difficulty setting to change `MAX_GUESSES` and `NUM_DIGITS`.~~
  * [ ] Allow for changing difficulty at the end of each game.
* [ ] Try to create a version with letters as well as digits.
