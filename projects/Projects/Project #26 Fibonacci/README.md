## TODO List:

The problem with the maths-based projects is that it's very easy for me to get distracted. Once I start reading up about the particular mathematical phenomena, I will run off down the rabbit hole and end up spending hours reading about maths. Which is fine, but not why I'm working through these projects... :sweat_smile:

In any case, after reading up about the [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), I started looking at its relationship to the [Golden Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio#Relationship_to_Fibonacci_sequence). For any given Fibonacci number <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F_n">, the ratio between it and the previous Fibonacci number, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F_{n-1}">, is approximately the Golden Ratio, as <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n"> approaches <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\infty">, or:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\ \frac{F_n}{F_{n-1}}=\varphi">

The higher the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n">, the closer the ratio is to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\varphi">, but it never reaches it. You can see this in the graph below show the difference between this ratio for the first 20 Fibonacci numbers and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\varphi">:
