"""Lucky Stars, by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com
A "press your luck" game where you roll dice to gather as many stars
as possible. You can roll as many times as you want, but if you roll
three skulls you lose all your stars.

Inspired by the Zombie Dice game from Steve Jackson Games.

print("""Lucky Stars, by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com

A "press your luck" game where you roll dice with Stars, Skulls, and
Question Marks.

On your turn, you pull three random dice from the dice cup and roll
them. You can roll Stars, Skulls, and Question Marks. You can end your
turn and get one point per Star. If you choose to roll again, you keep
the Question Marks and pull new dice to replace the Stars and Skulls.
If you collect three Skulls, you lose all your Stars and end your turn.

When a player gets 13 points, everyone else gets one more turn before
the game ends. Whoever has the most points wins.

There are 6 Gold dice, 4 Silver dice, and 3 Bronze dice in the cup.
Gold dice have more Stars, Bronze dice have more Skulls, and Silver is
even.
