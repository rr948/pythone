# Lucky Stars
___
_by Al Sweigart_ [al@inventwithpython.com](mailto:al@inventwithpython.com)

A "press your luck" game where you roll dice to gather as many stars
as possible. You can roll as many times as you want, but if you roll
three skulls you lose all your stars.

Inspired by the Zombie Dice game from Steve Jackson Games.
