## TODO List:

* [x] ~~The first _n_ Prime Numbers~~

It's briefly alluded to in the original program, but using this program, it would be relatively easy to modify to list _n_ prime numbers. Deliberately not changing the original `factorfinder.py` too much, I've created `primefinder.py` to return the first _n_ prime numbers as follows: 

```
Enter a positive whole number (n) to fine prime numbers up to the nth (or QUIT):
> 10
The first 10 prime numbers are:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 
```

`primefinder.py` does the job, but it far from an efficient algorithm to find primes. As there is a Prime Numbers project later in the book (see Project #56), I'll leave a more in-depth exploration of prime numbers and algorithms to identify them till then.
