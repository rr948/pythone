The ancient seed-sowing game.

The ancient two-player seed-sowing game. Grab the seeds from a pit on
your side and place one in each following pit, going counterclockwise
and skipping your opponent's store. If your last seed lands in an empty
pit of yours, move the opposite pit's seeds into that pit. The
goal is to get the most seeds in your store on the side of the board.
If the last placed seed is in your store, you get a free turn.

The game ends when all of one player's pits are empty. The other player
claims the remaining seeds for their store, and the winner is the one
with the most seeds.

## TODO List:

* [ ] Change the board to have more pits.
* [ ] Randomly select a bonus pit that, when the last seed lands in it, lets the player take another turn.
* [ ] Create a square-shaped board for four players instead of two.
