!["The Collatz Conjecture states that if you pick a number, and it's even divide it by two and it it's odd multiply by three and add one, and you repeat this procedure long enough, eventually your friends will stop calling to see if you want to hang out."](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/collatz_conjecture.png "XKCD - Collatz Conjecture")

## TODO List:

* [x] ~~Think of an interesting way to visualise the Collatz Sequence.~~

There are a lot of [interesting ways to visualise the Collatz Sequence](https://www.google.com/search?q=collatz+sequence+visualisations&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwj525nKjPX0AhUPsxoKHWx9BecQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=collatz+sequence+visualisations&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQA1CoBFioBGDKCGgAcAB4AIABTYgBlwGSAQEymAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=AOTBYfnbFY_mauz6lbgO&bih=1315&biw=1279&client=firefox-b-d#imgrc=qb0IAMDxH71_8M). I wanted to give one of them a go, so I plugged the numbers generated from the sequence into a Plotly scatter plot:

It's interesting to note the patterns and differences that occur in the sequence. For example, _n=1000_ takes a very circuitous path, taking over 100 steps and at one point reaching 9232, over 9 times the original starting _n_.

In contrast, _n=10,000_ only takes 20 steps to reach 1 and smoothly reaches 1 with few dramatic changes in _n_. 

![](images/collatz_sequence_n10000.png)

As the sequences get closer to 1, they begin to converge. For instance, both _n_=100 and _n_=10,000 pass through _n_=88, but they arrive there from different routes (_n=10,000_ : _176/2_, _n=100_ : _3(29)+1_)

Odd numbers become even numbers through _3n+1_, while even numbers can become either even or odd through _2/n_. The sequence is "trying to find" a power of 2. The powers of 2 tend directly to 1, never hitting an odd number:

(^Collatz Sequence for 2²⁰, which only takes 20 steps to reach 1)

Other even numbers will eventually hit an odd number; the _3n+1_ function then "shifts" up to the next path of even numbers to continue the search. You can see this clearly in _n=100_:

![](images/collatz_sequence_n100.png)

When you plot the number of steps it takes for any given initial _n_, it produces interesting patterns:

Up to _n=10_:

![](images/collatz_sequences_num_steps_n10.png)

Up to _n=100_:

![](images/collatz_sequences_num_steps_n100.png)

Up to _n=1000_:

![](images/collatz_sequences_num_steps_n1000.png)

Up to _n=10000_:

![](images/collatz_sequences_num_steps_n10000.png)

Up to _n=100000_:

![](images/collatz_sequences_num_steps_n100000.png)

Up to _n=1000000_:

![](images/collatz_sequences_num_steps_n1000000.png)


In the pattern, you can clearly see that certain numbers require a significantly greater number of steps to reach 1 than their neighbouring numbers. The number of steps required doesn't necessarily increase with a greater _n_. There are many numbers < 200k that take more than 300 steps to reach 1 and conversely many numbers over 1m that can reach 1 in fewer than 100 steps (e.g. n=1048576 or 2²⁰ as seen above). 

(I'd be really interested to know more about why these numbers take so few/many steps. E.g. [27 takes 111 steps(!) to reach 1](images/collatz_sequence_n27.png)... n < 27 take no more than 20-ish steps to get to 1, then [BOOM](images/collatz_sequences_num_steps_n27.png)... how/why/what is that about?! I presume there's some interesting mathematical properties to the numbers that "shoot up out of the pack". But this is supposed to be a Python learning project, not a maths one. It'll take some time to research and understand everything going on here, and I've already gotten _waaaaaay_ too distracted excitedly thinking about all this maths as it is... :sweat_smile: Perhaps another time!)


## Still TODO:

* [ ] Figure out how to create a tree plot/network graph of the sequence

What I _had_ been trying to get working originally was a treeplot or network diagram of the sequence. There many nice implementations of this online ([such as](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Collatz-graph-20-iterations.svg)), but I'm not overly familiar with the libraries used to plot them, and when I attempted myself, it was really complicated trying to format and style the mess of numbers and paths into a _structured_ mess. I'll play around with tree/network diagrams and come back to this later.
