Sudoku is a number placement logic puzzle game. A Sudoku grid is a 9 x 9
grid of numbers. Try to place numbers in the grid such that every row,
column, and 3x3 box has the numbers 1 through 9 once and only once.

For example, here is a starting Sudoku grid and its solved form:

    5 3 . | . 7 . | . . .     5 3 4 | 6 7 8 | 9 1 2
    6 . . | 1 9 5 | . . .     6 7 2 | 1 9 5 | 3 4 8
    . 9 8 | . . . | . 6 .     1 9 8 | 3 4 2 | 5 6 7
    ------+-------+------     ------+-------+------
    8 . . | . 6 . | . . 3     8 5 9 | 7 6 1 | 4 2 3
    4 . . | 8 . 3 | . . 1 --> 4 2 6 | 8 5 3 | 7 9 1
    7 . . | . 2 . | . . 6     7 1 3 | 9 2 4 | 8 5 6
