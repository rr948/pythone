TODO List:
---

* [ ] Add variety by making the game configurable so you can specify any sizes for the three buckets and any amount for the goal quantity.

* [ ] Add a “hint” that examines the amount of water in each bucket and provides the next step to take. If the program can’t figure out which action to take next, it can simply display “I don’t know what you should do next. Maybe start over?”
