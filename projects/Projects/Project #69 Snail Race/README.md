TODO List:
---

* [ ] Add a random “speed boost” that launches the snail four spaces ahead instead of one.
* [ ] Add a “sleep mode” that snails can randomly enter during the race. This mode causes them to stop for a few turns and zzz to appear next to them.
* [ ] Add support for ties, in case snails reach the finish line at the same time
