NOTE: This program requires the sevenletterwords.txt file. You can
download it [here](https://inventwithpython.com/sevenletterwords.txt).

## TODO List:

* [ ] Create own `sevenletterwords.txt` file, or create lists with different lenghts of words (i.e. 6 or 8-letter words)
* [ ] Create a different visualisation of the "computer memory" (perhaps using the ["Digital Stream"](Projects/Project%20%2320%20Digital%20Stream)? )
