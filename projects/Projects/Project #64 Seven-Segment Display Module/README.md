## TODO List:

* [ ] Create new fonts for numbers, such as using five rows and the block character string returned by chr(9608).
* [ ] Look at the Wikipedia article for seven-segment displays to find out how to display letters and then add those to sevseg.py.
* [ ] Learn about sixteen-segment displays from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteen-segment_display and create a sixteenseg.py module to generate numbers in that style.
