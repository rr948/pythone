## TODO List:

* [ ] Create a one-line animation of a spinner that alternates between the characters |, /, -, and \ to produce a rotating effect.
* [ ] Create a program that can display a scrolling marquee of text moving from left to right.
* [ ] Create a one-line animation that displays a set of four equal signs moving back and forth as a single unit, similar to the red scanning light on the robot car from the TV show Knight Rider or the Cylon robot face from the TV show Battlestar Galactica.
