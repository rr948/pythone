## TODO List:

* [ ] Add “Lizard” and “Spock” moves to the game. Lizard poisons Spock and eats paper, but is crushed by rock and decapitated by scissors. Spock breaks scissors and vaporizes rock, but is poisoned by lizard and disproved by paper.
* [ ] Allow the player to win a point for each victory and lose a point for each defeat. Upon winning, the player can also take “double or nothing” risks to possibly win 2, 4, 8, 16, and an increasing number of points in subsequent rounds.
