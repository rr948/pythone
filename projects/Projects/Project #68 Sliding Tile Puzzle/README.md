## TODO List:

* [ ] Create a more difficult 5 × 5 variant of the sliding tile puzzle.
* [ ] Create a “solve automatically” mode, which saves the current arrangement of the tiles and then attempts up to 40 random moves and stops if they have solved the puzzle. Otherwise, the puzzle loads the saved state and attempts another 40 random moves.
