## TODO List:

* [ ] Modify `CUBE_CORNERS` and the tuple on line 184 to create different wireframe models such as a pyramid and a flat hexagon.
* [ ] Increase the coordinates of `CUBE_CORNERS` by 1.5 so that the cube revolves around the center of the screen, rather than rotating around its own center.
